## 1.3 Overall training data size and characteristics 

### 1.3.1 Size of dataset and characteristics 

**1.3.1.A Text training data size:** 1 billion to 10 trillion tokens 

 

**1.3.1.B Text training data content:** The training data for Phi-4-mini-reasoning consists exclusively of synthetic mathematical content generated by a stronger and more advanced reasoning model, Deepseek-R1. The objective is to distill knowledge from this model. This synthetic dataset comprises over one million diverse math problems spanning multiple levels of difficulty (from middle school to Ph.D. level). For each problem in the synthetic dataset, eight distinct solutions (rollouts) were sampled, and only those verified as correct were retained.
